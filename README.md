Working on roblox games, and also Unity and C++ Unreal, currently learning lua as im making a roblox game, i know it's not that hard doing roblox games, but i am a beginner
so yeah, i am  going to start learning i might post here some code for people to copy if i figure stuff, cause i am trying to figure stuff on my own, not just copy a tutorial
but yeah, i will leave some code if i think it's worth it. so yeah watch my repositories. Bye!
